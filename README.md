# TwitterWebScraper

This is a primitive WebScraper for Twitter.com

Please note, this is a work-in-progress and this is my first experience with BeautifulSoup and selenium libraries.

All tweets are printed to file tweets.txt
Any tweet with a nextline character will be separated due to the storing and sorting process; this will be fixed in the future.

In order to bypass twitter's infinite scroll function, a webdriver is used.
